/* 
Sample Requirements:

● "Create a reusable progress bar component that accepts a percentage value"
● "Add smooth animation when the progress changes"
● "Handle edge cases like negative values or values over 100%"

Follow-up Questions:

● "How would you make this component accessible?"
● "What if we wanted to support different shapes (circular, linear)?"
● "What props would you expose for maximum flexibility?"
